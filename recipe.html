        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and pulse until smooth.</br> Transfer to a medium bowl </li>
        <li>Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the blender,</br> and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining â…“ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot</br> over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the water</br> has cooked out and the puree is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, garlic powder, ginger,</br> dried herbs, and crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes,</br> stirring occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep red</br> in color.</li>
        <li>Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce</br> the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for another </br>30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
